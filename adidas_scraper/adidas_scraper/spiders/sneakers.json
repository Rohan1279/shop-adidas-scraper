With influences ranging from aquatic life to terrace culture, the Handball Top x Mike uses a classic handball silhouette as the foundation for abstraction. Fusing terrace-inspired handball shoes with trail runner aesthetics, the Handball Top x Mike offers a mixed-material upper constructed of suede, mesh and neoprene and is finished with a unique lace-stopper closure. Retooled for skateboarding, the Handball Top x Mike offers a new take on vintage terrace culture design and performance.",

They feature Adiprene+ cushioning for soft landings and a Torsion System underfoot that supports your decisive first step. The upper is built to match the most iconic sneakers McGrady wore on the court.Made in part with recycled content generated from production waste, e.g. cutting scraps, and post-consumer household waste to avoid the larger environmental impact of producing virgin content.",

But they also went way beyond that, earning a prized place in the hip-hop world and soon, mainstream culture. They continue to evolve even now, and this release proves it. With details reminiscent of an '80s aesthetic, they sport an all-leather upper and Stylized ostrich pattern for a subtle kick of style.
